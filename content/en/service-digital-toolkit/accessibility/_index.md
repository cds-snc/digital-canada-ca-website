Building accessible digital services means meeting the needs of as many people as possible. Ensuring that everyone can interact with our services in a way that meets their individual needs and promotes their independence and dignity is important to us. 
At the Canadian Digital Service, we are committed to building accessible and inclusive services by working across all disciplines â€” blurring the lines between research, development, design and accessibility.
