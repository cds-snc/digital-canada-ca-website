The Service and Digital Toolkit (SDT) is a collection of practical, bilingual resources designed to help Government of Canada teams improve digital service delivery.

Whether you’re adopting agile ways of working, designing accessible services, or navigating digital transformation, the SDT provides actionable guidance, case studies, and tools to support your work. It aligns with the Policy on Service and Digital and the Digital Standards Playbook, helping teams create services that are agile, open and designed with people at the centre.

## What’s inside?

Built on real experiences and learnings from the Canadian Digital Service (CDS) and its partners, the SDT offers flexible, structured and bilingual guidance on: accessibility, agile service delivery and user-centred design.

## Help shape the toolkit

The SDT is a living resource, and we want your feedback to make it even better. Tell us about your biggest challenges, the resources you need, or what’s working well for your team. Your feedback will help us improve and expand the toolkit to better serve the GC community.
