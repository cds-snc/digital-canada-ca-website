user-centered-design encourages continuous and iterative delivery to keep up with the evolving needs of people. Developing services in this way can be challenging in government. It might require changes to how projects are planned and approved, how infrastructure is accessed, and the tools available for development and publishing. At the Canadian Digital Service, we try to focus on building incrementally with modular parts that might make it easier to course correct and deliver more value.
