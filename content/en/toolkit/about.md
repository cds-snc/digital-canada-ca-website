The [Canadian Digital Service (CDS)](https://digital.canada.ca/) is starting to curate and share learning resources in a publicly accessible and centralized space online.

Over the years, CDS has created resources as a result of our experiences working on delivery challenges and collaborating with different federal departments and agencies. Those resources have helped guide our work internally, but have often been inaccessible by the rest of government.

Our hope is that by sharing what we have learned _**in the open**_, these resources might serve as practical examples that could be leveraged by others who are working to design and deliver their own public services.

**CDS Learning Resources aims to include actionable information that address specific delivery challenges in our work.**

Some examples of this might include:

- templates for hiring different digital skills into government.
    
- guides for conducting inclusive research or compensating participants.
    
- tools and frameworks for conducting accessibility testing.
    
- technical plays for building an effective digital service.
    

It’s important to note, we are **not** here to share generic best practice, create course material, or training that is offered through other teams, channels, or mechanisms.

Our Learning Resources are grounded in sharing things our teams have tried, within our Canadian context and through our work at CDS, that we hope could be leveraged across government.
