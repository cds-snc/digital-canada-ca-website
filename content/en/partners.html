            <div>
                <p>CDS is committed to working with a range of partners to align and adapt to the evolving digital landscape and work towards a more responsive digital government as outlined in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/canada-digital-ambition/canada-digital-ambition-2024-25.html">Canada’s Digital Ambition 2024-25</a>.</p>
                <p>The Strategic Partnerships and Engagement Team (SPE) collaborates with a variety of external partners to help deliver CDS’ mandate. When we work with provincial, territorial and international governments we want to make sure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The products and services Canada is developing can work with other jurisdictions</li>
                    <li>Mutually advance the development and acceptance of digital solutions</li>
                    <li>Learning and building from each other’s experiences</li>
                    <li>Building effective, efficient and trustworthy services enabled by data and technology</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Along with governments, we work with academia and organizations representing traditionally underserved communities to help make it possible for CDS to chart a path forward for federal services that are innovative, equitable, and inclusive from end-to-end. </p>
