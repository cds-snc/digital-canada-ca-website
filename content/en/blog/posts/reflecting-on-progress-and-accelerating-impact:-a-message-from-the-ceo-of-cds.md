<p>One year ago, we published our <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/reports/strategy-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>2024-27 Strategic Vision</strong></a> and our <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/reports/tactical-plan-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>2024-25 Tactical Plan</strong></a>, a milestone that reaffirmed <strong>the mission of the Canadian Digital Service (CDS):</strong> <strong>to advance the goals of the </strong><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/canada-digital-ambition/canada-digital-ambition-2024-25.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Digital Ambition</strong></a><strong> and improve service experiences in the Government of Canada</strong>. This work laid the foundation for us to establish momentum to drive deeper and lasting change across the public service.</p>



<p>Today, I’m excited to highlight the progress we’ve made together over the past year and set the stage for what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Our new <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/reports/annual-report-2024.pdf?utm_campaign=esdc-edsc-intcomms-24-25&amp;utm_medium=smo&amp;utm_source=lnkn&amp;utm_content=annual-report-2025-en-250814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>2024-25 Annual Report</strong></a> and <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/reports/tactical-plan-2025.pdf?utm_campaign=esdc-edsc-intcomms-24-25&amp;utm_medium=smo&amp;utm_source=lnkn&amp;utm_content=tactical-plan-2025-en-250814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>2025-26 Tactical Plan</strong></a> not only mark another year of progress, but a deepening of our commitment to improving how the government serves people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a world that’s changing rapidly, this mission has never been more urgent or meaningful.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2024/2025 Annual Report: A year of progress</strong></h3>



<p>Over the past year, CDS has supported departments across the Government of Canada in making public services more secure, accessible, and focused on the people they serve. From minimizing duplication to improving the consistency and usability of services, our teams have helped unlock real impact at scale. This report outlines key results, presents compelling ‘powered by CDS’, use cases and tells the story of what happens when we invest in common capabilities for the enterprise and when we share that work.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2025/2026 Tactical Plan: A blueprint for action</strong></h3>



<p>As we look forward, our Tactical Plan lays out a focused, flexible path for the year ahead, one that reflects our values, supports innovation, and aligns with the broader <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/reports/strategy-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDS 2024-2027 Strategic Vision</a>. We’ve embraced an adaptive approach to planning that mirrors how we build our products and services, one that allows iteration and the ability&nbsp;to respond to changing priorities, while staying focused on the outcomes that matter most. <strong>It’s not just a plan, it’s an invitation</strong>. <strong>An invitation to public servants across government to break down silos and embark on this important journey with us, because we can only deliver digital services that meet people’s expectations if we do it together</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2025-2026, we will continue to advance our mission by scaling digital solutions, strengthening departmental capabilities, and staying focused on outcomes that matter to Canadians:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Our platform products<strong>, GC Notify, GC Forms, and</strong> <strong>GC Design System,</strong> continue to improve service delivery. </li>



<li>Through the <strong>Digital Transformation Office (DTO), we make it easier for Canadians to find and use services on </strong><a href="http://canada.ca"><strong>Canada.ca</strong></a>, especially during key life moments.</li>



<li><strong>With our flagship products, GC Sign in and GC Issue and Verify</strong>, we’re building a secure, seamless digital front door to government services.</li>



<li><strong>We also relaunched our Services</strong> <strong>team</strong>, shifting from delivering solutions to supporting government departments with the right skills and talent, empowering public servants to co-create and design services that last.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let’s keep building together</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll continue to work in the open, and we invite you to follow along. <strong>You can track our progress on our <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cds-snc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a> or by subscribing to our <a href="https://us15.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=729a207773f7324e217a1d945&amp;id=eb357181d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newsletter</a></strong>. We’ll be sharing regular updates as we deliver on the commitments outlined in this year’s plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meaningful change doesn’t happen in isolation, it’s a shared effort. Whether you&#8217;re part of CDS, a government partner, or someone who interacts with public services, we appreciate the opportunity to work with you. Creating digital services that meet people’s needs requires collaboration across departments and communities, and a commitment to breaking down barriers and building strong connections across the public service.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thank you team CDS</strong></h3>



<p>I also want to take a moment to sincerely thank the incredible team at CDS. The progress captured in this year’s report is a direct result of your passion, creativity, and dedication to public service. You’ve shown what’s possible when mission-driven people come together to tackle big challenges, and I couldn’t be more proud to work alongside you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Let’s keep pushing boundaries. Let’s keep delivering impact. And let’s keep making a real difference for everyone who depends on the programs and services of the Government of Canada.</strong><br><br><br></p>
