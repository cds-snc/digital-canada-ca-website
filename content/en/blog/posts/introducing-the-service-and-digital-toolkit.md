<p>Teams across the GC are working hard to improve their services, meet user needs, and make the most of digital tools, but navigating evolving digital standards, policies, and priorities isn’t easy. At CDS, we’ve experienced these challenges first-hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digital.canada.ca/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our mission</a> is to help departments improve service delivery by leveraging <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital tools</a> effectively. To support this, <strong>we’ve created a <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/service-digital-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Service and Digital Toolkit (SDT)</a> — a curated collection of resources, including practical guidance, case studies, and best practices, to help teams tackle common service challenges. </strong>The toolkit directly aligns with the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Policy on Service and Digital</a> and the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Standards Playbook</a>, to help teams create digital services that are agile, open, and designed with people at the centre.</p>



<p><strong>The Service and Digital Toolkit provides:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valuable insights on service design and delivery improvement, especially if you’re seeking tools that enable agile service delivery, like the <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/2024/11/05/measuring-progress-a-product-maturity-model-for-digital-government/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Product Maturity Model</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Documentation on <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/service-digital-toolkit/user-centred-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user-centered service design</a> practices, standards, and tools, including <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/service-digital-toolkit/user-centred-design/interaction-design-at-cds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interaction design</a> and <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/service-digital-toolkit/user-centred-design/content-design-at-cds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content design</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Resources for building accessible services, including <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/2024/10/17/plain-language-updates-to-the-canada.ca-content-style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best practices for plain language</a> and a <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/2024/09/04/how-updating-gc-notifys-accessibility-statement-helped-us-build-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">case study on updating GC Notify’s accessibility statements</a>.</p>



<p>By bringing together practical and bilingual guidance grounded in real experiences and learnings from CDS and its partners, the toolkit can help your team navigate challenges, adopt modern ways of working, and design user-centered services that are accessible and informed by the GC’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Standards Playbook</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-we-curate-the-toolkit">How did we curate the toolkit?</h2>



<p>Unlike a static set of best practices, the toolkit is a living resource that focuses on the &#8216;how,&#8217; and provides adaptable guidance that public servants can shape to fit their own contexts across the GC. Rather than prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach, we want to help empower users to take what’s useful, apply it in their own way, and drive meaningful change within their teams.</p>



<p><strong>We designed the toolkit to be easy to access, navigate, and share, with structured guidance on topics like agile service delivery, user-centred design, and accessibility.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also includes a variety of resources, from guides and templates to case studies, frameworks, and practical tools, designed to help teams answer key questions, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How can I design or improve a service that meets the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Standards Playbook</a>?</li>



<li>What resources can support my team in making a case for change?</li>



<li>What practical tools can help streamline my workflow?</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tell-us-what-you-think">Tell us what you think</h2>



<p>As we’re still in the early stages of developing the Service and Digital Toolkit, we want to ensure it meets your needs in your specific context, with your current goals. That’s why <strong>we’re inviting you to share your questions, feedback, and ideas (</strong><a href="mailto:cds-snc@servicecanada.gc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>via email</strong></a><strong>).&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We’d love to learn what kinds of resources are most useful to you and your team, and what your main challenges are when it comes to finding tools to help improve service design and delivery.&nbsp;</p>
