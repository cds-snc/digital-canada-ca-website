Check out the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7254128099473215488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original post</a>.</p>



<p>October marks Women’s History Month.&nbsp;This year’s theme,<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/women-gender-equality/commemorations-celebrations/womens-history-month/2024-theme.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Women at Work: Economic Growth Past, Present and Future</a>, highlights the significant contributions women have made to the workforce throughout history, and the critical role they continue to play in driving economic innovation and progress that has benefited Canada as a whole.</p>



<p>At CDS, we’re committed to working with the next generation of tech talent to make our services more inclusive and accessible.</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioanacontu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ioana Contu, </a>Team Lead, <a href="https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/forms-formulaires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GC Forms</a> was a judge at this year&#8217;s <a href="https://itstechnova.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechNova Hackathon</a> with the University of Waterloo! Ioana is passionate about enabling teams to build inclusive, efficient, and accessible services through human-centred design.</p>



<p>At the Hackathon, open to women and non-binary students at uWaterloo, Ioana gave students the challenge of building a speech-to-text proof of concept that would enable users to complete a (government) form using their voice alone. Speech-to-text technology can simplify and enhance the accessibility of online government forms, ensuring everyone can access the benefits they need. Such a tool could be integrated into GC Forms for an even more accessible experience. &nbsp;<br>We asked Ioana a few questions about her experience working with the students.</p>

<li><strong>How did you find the event?</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>It was very interesting to meet and interact with all these young women+ at the Technova Hackathon. It’s refreshing to see so many young women+ folks so involved and motivated. It gives me more hope for the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was also truly inspiring to witness the strong leadership and sense of community driving the movement for greater inclusion of gender minorities in tech. Events like Technova are fostering safe, inclusive, and empowering spaces where women and non-binary individuals can start, grow, and thrive in the technology industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was also impressed by how this group of women+ students seamlessly organised and executed a large, complex event—managing everything from participant needs and sponsor engagement to workshops, catering, the hackathon itself, and project judging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was deeply grateful to have the chance to be part of such an event. The inclusion of Women+ in Tech is a cause that’s close to my heart. Over the past decade working in the tech industry, I’ve seen firsthand how quickly organisations strive to hire diverse talent, yet often overlook the ongoing effort required to create spaces where underrepresented individuals feel safe, supported, and empowered to succeed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As leaders in tech, I think it’s crucial for us to recognize that true inclusion goes beyond hiring—it’s the daily work we do with our teams to foster environments where everyone can thrive. Being at this event reminded me of my responsibility to these individuals—not just to ensure they are represented, but to foster spaces where they truly belong.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>How many participants were involved and what kind of challenges were the students working on?</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>There were about 200 participants in total taking on challenges related in one way or another to the themes of women+ empowerment and/or sustainability. They were organised in teams of 2 to 4 people per project. And their projects were very optimistic.</p>



<p>The overall winning project was a project called IronWill &#8211; to support people with iron deficiency. Literally a screening tool that combines advanced image recognition with a user-friendly chatbot. Users upload pictures of their nails, eyes, or palms, and the system delivers feedback with chats for more anaemic insights.</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>That sounds quite creative!</strong> <strong>Not only were you a judge at the event, but you also gave a presentation about CDS. What was that like?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>My CDS presentation went well, I was surprised so many people showed up to it given that it was the first thing in the early morning on Saturday! For the submissions to our challenge, we had a few projects that integrated some sort of a speech-to-text functionality in their project &#8211; without it being the focus per se. The winning project was a dedicated app meant to facilitate government form filling experience with the help of a virtual assistant that can help a person fill out a form.&nbsp; The technology they used for the speech-to-text functionality would be compatible with GC Forms. This project checked most of the criteria for the CDS challenge.</p>

<p>It’s encouraging to see such innovative solutions&nbsp; emerge from the next generation of tech professionals, as they develop skills and share new perspectives.</p>
