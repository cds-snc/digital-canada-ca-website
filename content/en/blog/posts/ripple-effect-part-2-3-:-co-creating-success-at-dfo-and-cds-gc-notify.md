<p>The CDOS team has been working with CDS product teams to find ways to streamline workflows, scale impact, and shape the future of digital initiatives. These collaboration efforts have generated helpful feedback for all teams, resulting in product and service improvements at DFO and CDS.</p>

<p>DFO uses the Enterprise Data Hub (EDH), which requires the cataloguing and storage of the organization’s data, and is one of the key platforms of DFO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many types of requests users can make in the hub, including uploading data to the hub’s catalogue and openly publishing data for public access. <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/organization/dfo-mpo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DFO has over 700 published datasets in the GC&#8217;s Open Government Portal</a>; openly sharing data can help raise awareness with the public and is useful for people working on protection and/or restoration initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://documentation.notification.canada.ca/en/?utm_source=EN_blog_Notify_grants_contributions&amp;utm_id=Notify_API%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Using GC Notify’s Application Programming Interface (API) integration</a>, the hub automatically sends email updates and reminders to required users about actions to take, such as letting data reviewers know it’s ready for sign-off on publication.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key impact of using GC Notify at DFO:</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>We’ve sent almost 10,000 emails since adopting GC Notify in 2023!</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Without the API sending updates, requests, confirmations, and reminder emails to users, we would’ve needed human intervention and coordination in our processes.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It would’ve also required a lot of manual work on business logic. GC Notify made this a lot easier for us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>How the Enterprise Data Hub updates users via GC Notify.</summary>
<p><strong>Russell Moore:</strong></p>



<p>The Enterprise Data Hub is an application public servants at DFO use for cataloguing and storing data throughout the department.</p>



<p><strong>There are two user actions/requests in the data hub that GC Notify helps with:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>External to DFO: Request the publication of data in the hub out to the </strong><a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/organization/dfo-mpo?res_type=dataset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GC’s Open Government Portal</strong></a><strong> </strong><strong>and/or to the Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP).</strong><br>When publishing is requested, GC Notify automatically sends an email to the people who are required to review that data and sign off on the publication. We’ve also coded the API integration to send a follow-up email if the data is not reviewed in a timely manner, making the approvals coordination hands-off.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Internal to DFO: Request a service offering, such as uploading data to the hub’s catalogue.</strong>                                                                                                             Users can also request to have a map created for their geospatial data, to upload with the data. When a service offering is requested, GC Notify automatically sends emails to the requester as a confirmation, as well as to the people who need to take action to complete the task.</li>
</ol>
</details>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advice from DFO for using GC Notify</strong></h3>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>“You don’t have to reinvent the wheel here, use it!” – Russell Moore</summary>
<p>Just go ahead and use GC Notify because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel here. It’s an accessible and secure tool that’s commonly used by dozens of departments, so why not just incorporate that in your applications? It can do a lot of work for you (freeing up capacity) and it just makes life a lot easier.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Think GC Notify can help with your service delivery?</strong></h2>



<p>Our support team frequently hosts demo and forum sessions for public servants to learn how the notification product can help with their service delivery. Participants get the opportunity to ask questions and hear from other teams about how they think the tool could help them (potentially inspiring ideas). <a href="https://notification.canada.ca/register-for-a-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pick an upcoming date to attend a GC Notify demo</a>!&nbsp;</p>
