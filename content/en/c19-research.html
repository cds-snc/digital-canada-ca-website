            <p>We at the Government of Canada are in the process of making improvements to our Covid-19 website. We are conducting research studies in the upcoming weeks to understand how effective our website is for people who are experiencing financial stress.
The studies will be conducted through an online video-conferencing session and should take about 30 minutes. No expertise about Covid-19 is required.</p>
