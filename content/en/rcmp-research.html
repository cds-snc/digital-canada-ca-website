            <h2 class="section--title">Help us design a service to report cybercrimes to the Royal Canadian Mounted
                Police (RCMP)</h2>

            <p>Have you, or anyone you know, ever been phished, hacked or called by a scammer? Whether or not you’ve
                been affected, you can help us fight cyber crimes and scams by participating in research. </p>

            <p>We’d like to speak to Canadians about online crime and have you try out a reporting tool we’ve been developing with the RCMP. You don’t need to be a victim of a scam or have any previous web experience, but you will need to be able to access a website and participate in a video call.</p>

            <p>If you would like to help us, or know someone else who can, please contact <a
                    href="mailto:CDSResearch-SNCRecherche@tbs-sct.gc.ca">CDSResearch-SNCRecherche@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a> for more information on how to be involved.
